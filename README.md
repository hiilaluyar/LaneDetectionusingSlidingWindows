Lane Detection Project

This project implements a lane detection algorithm using computer vision techniques. It processes a video feed, identifies lane markings using perspective transformation and color thresholding, and displays the detected lanes in real-time.

Features
Perspective Transformation: Converts the camera view to a top-down perspective to better analyze lane markings.
Color Thresholding: Uses HSV color space to isolate lane markings based on color.
Sliding Window Technique: Applies a sliding window approach to detect lane lines accurately.
Real-time Visualization: Displays original video feed, transformed view, and lane detection results simultaneously.
